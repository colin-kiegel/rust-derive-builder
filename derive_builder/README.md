# Builder Pattern Derive

[Rust][rust] macro to automatically implement the **builder pattern** for arbitrary structs. A simple `#[derive(Builder)]` will generate a `FooBuilder` for your struct `Foo` with all setter-methods and a build method.

## How it Works

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate derive_builder;

#[derive(Default, Builder, Debug)]
#[builder(setter(into))]
struct Channel {
    token: i32,
    special_info: i32,
    // .. a whole bunch of other fields ..
}

fn main() {
    // builder pattern, go, go, go!...
    let ch = ChannelBuilder::default()
        .special_info(42u8)
        .token(19124)
        .build()
        .unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", ch);
}
```

Note that we did not write any definition or implementation of `ChannelBuilder`. Instead the `derive_builder` crate acts on `#[derive(Builder)]` and generates the necessary code at compile time.

This is the generated boilerplate code you didn't need to write. :-)

```rust,ignore
#[derive(Clone, Default)]
struct ChannelBuilder {
    token: Option<i32>,
    special_info: Option<i32>,
}

#[allow(dead_code)]
impl ChannelBuilder {
    pub fn token<VALUE: Into<i32>>(&mut self, value: VALUE) -> &mut Self {
        let mut new = self;
        new.token = Some(value.into());
        new
    }
    pub fn special_info<VALUE: Into<i32>>(&mut self, value: VALUE) -> &mut Self {
        let mut new = self;
        new.special_info = Some(value.into());
        new
    }
    fn build(&self) -> Result<Channel, String> {
        Ok(Channel {
            token: Clone::clone(self.token
                .as_ref()
                .ok_or(
                       "token must be initialized")?),
            special_info: Clone::clone(self.special_info
                .as_ref()
                .ok_or("special_info must be initialized")?),
        })
    }
}
```

## Get Started

It's as simple as two steps:

1. Add `derive_builder` to your `Cargo.toml` either manually or
with [cargo-edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit):

  * `cargo add derive_builder`
2. Annotate your struct with `#[derive(Builder)]`

## Usage and Features

* **Chaining**: The setter calls can be chained, because they consume and return `&mut self` by default.
* **Builder patterns**: You can opt into other builder patterns by preceding your struct (or field) with `#[builder(pattern = "owned")]` or `#[builder(pattern = "immutable")]`.
* **Extensible**: You can still define your own implementations for the builder struct and define additional methods. Just make sure to name them differently than the setter and build methods.
* **Documentation and attributes**: Setter methods can be documented by simply documenting the corresponding field. Similarly `#[cfg(...)]` and `#[allow(...)]` attributes are also applied to the setter methods.
* **Hidden fields**: You can skip setters via `#[builder(setter(skip))]` on each field individually.
* **Setter visibility**: You can opt into private setter by preceding your struct with `#[builder(private)]`.
* **Setter type conversions**: With `#[builder(setter(into))]`, setter methods will be generic over the input types â€“ you can then supply every argument that implements the [`Into`][into] trait for the field type.
* **Setter strip option**: With `#[builder(setter(strip_option))]`, setter methods will take `T` as parameter'type for field of type `Option<T>`.
* **Builder field visibility**: You can use `#[builder(field(private))]` or `..(public)`, to set field visibility of your builder.
* **Generic structs**: Are also supported, but you **must not** use a type parameter named `VALUE`, if you also activate setter type conversions.
* **Default values**: You can use `#[builder(default)]` to delegate to the `Default` implementation or any explicit value via ` = ".."`. This works both on the struct and field level.
* **Pre-build validation**: You can use `#[builder(build_fn(validate = "path::to::fn"))]` to add your own validation before the target struct is generated.
* **Build method suppression**: You can use `#[builder(build_fn(skip))]` to disable auto-implementation of the build method and provide your own.
* **Builder derivations**: You can use `#[builder(derive(Trait1, Trait2, ...))]` to have the builder derive additonal traits. All builders derive `Default` and `Clone`, so you should not declare those in this attribute.
*  **no_std support**: Just add `#[builder(no_std)]` to your struct and add `#![feature(alloc)] extern crate alloc` to your crate. The latter requires the _nightly_ toolchain.
* **Logging**: If anything works unexpectedly you can enable detailed logs in two steps. First, add `features = ["logging"]` to the `derive_builder` dependency in `Cargo.toml`. Second, set this environment variable before calling cargo `RUST_LOG=derive_builder=trace`.

For more information and examples please take a look at our [documentation][doc].

This is a work in progress. So expect even more features in the future. :-)

## Gotchas

* Tuple structs and unit structs are not supported as they have no field names. We do not intend to support them.
* When defining a generic struct, you cannot use `VALUE` as a generic parameter as this is what all setters are using.
